pmpb = Poor Man's Package Builder
=================================

What it is
----------

A bunch of scripts that might make life easier building and upgrading
FreeBSD ports. It is written for myself, not to be general. I just
happen to feel that I might as well make them public.

What it is not
--------------

It is NOT a package manager (my long term plans like with pkgmanager -
http://www.scode.org/pkgmanager/ - but until nirvana this is what I
use).

It is NOT a proper generalized piece of software. There is no man
page. There is no configuration file. There are various assumptions
that happen to be correct for me, but may not be correct for you.

Overview of usage
-----------------

The idea is to build binary packages from scratch in a dedicated
package building jail, whose /etc/make.conf and
/usr/local/etc/ports.conf is kept synched with intended desination
installation hosts (along with the version of FreeBSD base).

The actual upgrade procedure involves removing ALL installed packages,
and re-installing from pre-built binary packages.

The end-result is that an upgrade, for me, once set up, basically
boils down to the following (DO NOT RUN THESE NOW, READ DETAILED
INSTRUCTIONS BELOW):

  - jail: portsnap update
  - jail: ./clean.sh
  - jail: ./build.sh all
  - host: <rsync cmd censored for safety>
  - host/other jails: ./clean.sh
  - host/other jails: ./install.sh all

More detailed instructions
--------------------------

WARNING: This is just a bunch of scripts. Things may blow up. For
example, if you have the package database in non-typical location, or
PREFIX is special, etc. I encourage reading all scripts FIRST.

One-time or periodic setup:

* You configure these scripts by modifying build.env.

* You set up a jail dedicated to building packages.

* You put a copy of this script in the host system and in the package
  building jail. You also put a copy in any additional jails in which
  you want stuff installed.

* You maintain your ports tree IN THE PACKAGE BUILDING JAIL, using
  portsnap or whatever method you choose.

* Your environment, with respect to ports, is defined by /etc/make.conf
  and /usr/local/etc/ports.conf (see ports-mgmt/portconf). If you have
  configuration expressed in pkgtools config files or something else
  - sorry.

* You create one or more files called "packages.X", where "X" is the name
  of the category of packages. The file is to contain one line of text per
  package, with the name of the package.

* You *must* have PACKAGES=/usr/ports/packages in /etc/make.conf, and
  /usr/ports/packages must exist in the package building jail.

* It is recommended to have BATCH=1 in /etc/make.conf.

* It is recommended to have FORCE_PACKAGE=1 in /etc/make.conf, since you're
  presumably building for your own purposes and you want stuff like
  screen (or licensingly bad stuff) built.

Frequent building:

* In the building jail: ./clean.sh to nuke all packages and the pkgtools
  package database as well as pre-existing binary packages.

* In the building jail: ./build.sh X (where X is the X from packages.X, signifying the category)

* In the host: rsync --delete -avWP necessary files. This should be
  /etc/make.conf, /usr/local/etc/ports.conf and all of
  /usr/ports. These should be rsynced to your host and/or to jails. I
  am not including a default script for this, because an rsync in
  general, and an rsync --delete in particular, can be extremely
  dangerous if incorrect.

* In host/other jails: ./clean.sh to clean out all installed packages.

* In host/other jails: ./install.sh X
