* build-deps aren't installed on target host unless they are also
  run-deps
* build env. not normalized w.r.t. other parts of dep tree such that
  dependency choices that are a function of installed packages are
  non-detemrinistic (IMO broken behavior in ports but I don't think
  ports people agree). this means, for example, that a package might first
  fail due to a conflict, but succeed on re-try because of different choice
  of dependency resulting from another unrelated package being installed
